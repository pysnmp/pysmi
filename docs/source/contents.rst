modules from their original ASN.1 form into JSON or `pysnmp <https://github.com/pysnmp/pysnmp>`_
representation.

MIB files archive
-----------------

The PySMI project maintains a `collection <https://pysnmp.github.io/mibs/asn1>`_
of publicly available ASN.1 MIB files collected on the Internet. You are
welcome to use this MIBs archive however we can't guarantee any degree
of consistency or reliability when it comes to these MIB modules.

The *mibdump* tool as well as many other utilities based on PySMI
are programmed to use this MIB repository for automatic download and
dependency resolution.

You can always reconfigure PySMI to use some other remote MIB repository
instead or in addition to this one.
