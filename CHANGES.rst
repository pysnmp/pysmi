  names picking up the latest MIB revision along the way.
- ZIP archive reader implemented to pull ASN.1 MIB files from .zip

Revision 0.2.1, 11-11-2017
--------------------------

- Added MIB *status*, *product release* and *revision description* set
  calls at pysnmp code generator

  defining particular MIB object

Revision 0.1.2, 12-04-2017
--------------------------

* The @mib@ magic in reader's URL template made optional. If it is not present,
  MIB module name is just appended to URL template

* Fixed missing STATUS/DISPLAY-HINT/REFERENCE/etc fields generation at pysnmp
  backend when running in the non-full-text mode
* Fixed broken `ordereddict` dependency on Python 2.6-

Revision 0.1.1, 30-03-2017
--------------------------

* Generate REFERENCE and STATUS fields at various SMI objects
* Generate DESCRIPTION field followed REVISION field at MODULE-IDENTITY objects
* Generate PRODUCT-RELEASE field at AGENT-CAPABILITIES objects
* Generated Python source aligned with PEP8
* MIB texts cleaned up by default, --keep-texts-layout preserves original formatting
* Fix to the `ordereddict` conditional dependency
* Missing test module recovered
* Failing tests fixed

Revision 0.1.0, 25-03-2017
--------------------------

* JSON code generating backend implemented
* Experimental JSON OID->MIB indices generation implemented
* Package structure flattened for easier use
* Minor refactoring to the test suite
* Source code statically analyzed, hardened and PEP8-ized
* Files closed explicitly to mute ResourceWarnings
* Fixed to Python 2.4 (and aged ply) compatibility
* Added a workaround to avoid generating pysnmp TextualConvention classes
  inheriting from TextualConvention (when MIB defines a TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
  based on another TEXTUAL-CONVENTION as SYNTAX)
* Author's e-mail changed, copyright extended to year 2017

Revision 0.0.7, 12-02-2016
--------------------------

* Crash on existing .py file handling fixed.
* Fix to __doc__ use in setup.py to make -O0 installation mode working.
